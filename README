Gidday!

This is the code for the book "The Linux Programming Interface"
and this is a note from me, the author, Michael Kerrisk.

For instructions on building the programs, see the file BUILDING.

For notes on changes that have been made to the code since it was
published in the book, see the file CHANGES.


Source code licensing
=====================

All complete programs provided in this distribution are covered by
the GNU General Public License (Version 3), a copy of which is
contained in the file COPYING.gpl-v3, which should have arrived with
this tarball.  The library functions (in the lib/ directory) are
covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License (Version 3); see the
file COPYING.lgpl-v3 provided with this tarball.


A note on the source code
=========================

The source code is available in two versions: "dist" and "book".
The "book" version contains the program source files as published in
the book. The source files in the "dist" version contain extra code
beyond that published in the book. The differences between the "dist"
and "book" versions are as follows:

a) The "dist" versions of some programs contain extra comments.
   These additional comments were stripped out of the printed version
   to make the published versions of the programs shorter. (The book
   itself contains text describing the operation of the programs.)

b) In a few cases, some changes have been incorporated into the
   "dist" versions to make it possible to compile programs on UNIX
   implementations other than Linux, so that you can try them out
   on other implementations if you wish.  Where necessary, the
   additional code is conditionally compiled using the following
   platform-specific macros:

        __linux__       Defined on Linux
        __sun           Defined on Solaris
        __FreeBSD__     Defined on FreeBSD
        __NetBSD__      Defined on NetBSD
        __OpenBSD__     Defined on OpenBSD
        __APPLE__       Defined on Mac OS X
        __hpux          Defined on HP-UX
        __osf__         Defined on Tru64 UNIX (formerly DEC OSF1)
        __sgi           Defined on Irix
        _AIX            Defined on AIX

c) In the "dist" version, some programs have extra functionality beyond
   that in the "book" versions. Where this is significant, comments in
   the programs explain the differences.


Subdirectories
==============

Under the 'tlpi' directory are a number of subdirectories. Each
subdirectory corresponds to one or more chapters of the book.
The following paragraphs give brief notes on the contents of
each subdirectory.

Note that in some cases, files are (hard) linked to appear in more than
one directory. This is particularly the case for each of the files in
the 'lib' directory, most of which are also linked in the directory
of the chapter relating to that file.
